# fizzbuzz pair program - Coral and David

## Fizzbuzz should do the following: 
- When divisable by 3, print "Fizz"
- When divisable by 5, print "Buzz"
- When divisable by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz"
- when none of the above, just print the given number

## refactored Fizzbuzz
  Whilst we refactored the code to one line using ternary operators,
  we've questioned wether it as readable code as the if/elsif/else block method
